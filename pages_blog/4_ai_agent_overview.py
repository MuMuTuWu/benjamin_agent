st.markdown("""### **1. Workflow-driven Agents**

Provides visual tools and modular frameworks to build reusable AI workflows for enterprises. Achieve task automation through visual process design, emphasizing rule orientation and modular expansion.

- **AI Development Platform**: Dify (an open-source LLM application building platform), Coze (a dedicated platform for chatbots)
	- Intuitive low-code workflow orchestration for non-coders, Visual RAG engine, and supports multi-model scheduling.
- **Image Workflow Tools**: ComfyUI (Open-source platform for AI-generated images and videos via visual node-based workflows.)
    - Core capabilities: Highly customizable for Stable Diffusion models, Supports complex generative pipelines.

##### Workflow: Prompt chaining

### 2. AI for Software Engineering

These tools focus on programming assistance and are suitable for developers to improve productivity.

- **Cursor** (an enhanced version of VS Code), **GitHub** Copilot (real-time code suggestions)
	- **Agent Mode:** Autonomous code generation and refactoring.
	- **Completion and Chat Mode:** Contextual understanding of codebases. Assists with code generation, completion, and debugging, understanding developer intent.

##### High-level flow of a coding agent

### **3. In-depth Research Agents**

Focused on deep information retrieval and multi-step reasoning, integrating online search and analysis to generate professional research reports with citations.

- **Perplexity/ChatGPT/Gemini/Grok**: They have in-depth research functions based on RAG, supporting multi-source verification and structured output.
	1. Broad Knowledge Base: Excels in diverse topics due to extensive training data, improving contextual analysis.
	2. Polished Outputs: Generates more natural, human-like reports with refined language.
	3. Robust Reasoning: Handles complex queries with nuanced understanding, especially for ambiguous topics.

### **4. General-purpose Autonomous Agents**

These agents possess the capabilities of **autonomous decision-making** and **cross-domain task execution**.

- **Manus AI**: It supports multi-modal processing of text, images, and code, and can independently complete complex tasks such as report writing and itinerary planning.
- **AutoGLM**: An open-source general-purpose agent framework that supports tool invocation and continuous learning (assuming a similar architecture to Manus).
